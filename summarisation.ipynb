To alleviate confusion and streamline the process, the Europe region will align with the rest of the world. Effective for pre-arbitration attempts processed on or after 15 October 2023, only the items in Table 11.6—Allowable Compelling Evidence in the Visa Rules will qualify as compelling evidence (ID#: 0030221).\n",
    "Pre-Arbitration Processing Requirements for Dispute Conditions 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4\n",
    "The Visa Rules allow certain delayed transactions, such as a transaction related to beverages from the mini fridge that occurred during a hotel stay or trip, or a parking violation that occurred while a cardholder was renting a car. Because these charges are billed after the cardholder’s departure or car rental return, an imprint for these charges cannot be obtained. However, an imprint obtained at any time during the stay / car rental (including at the time of check-in or vehicle check-out) can be used to demonstrate that the cardholder participated. Therefore, effective for pre-arbitration attempts processed on or after 14 October 2023, for a delayed transaction, the acquirer may supply evidence that the transaction relates to a prior stay, trip or rental period and evidence that an imprint was obtained during the same stay, trip or rental period to support their pre-arbitration attempt.\n",

    "As announced in the 16 June 2022 edition of the Visa Business News, the new remedy for Dispute Condition 10.4: Other Fraud—Card-Absent Environment requires an acquirer to provide a detailed description of the merchandise or services purchased. In an effort to provide the issuer with as much information / evidence to demonstrate cardholder participation, effective for pre-arbitration attempts processed on or after 14 October 2023, the acquirer will be required to supply a detailed description of the merchandise or services purchased for both the disputed transactions and the two previous undisputed transactions.\n",
